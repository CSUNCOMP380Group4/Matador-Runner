Group 4's project for CSUN COMP 380/L Summer 2021.

Matador Runner is a simple 2D side-scrolling platfomer made in the Unity 3D Game Engine.  Because of the short duration of the summer session, the scope of the game was keep limited in order to ensure the project was completed on time.  Instead the project was used as an opportunity to experience first hand working in a team-based software development environment.
